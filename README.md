# rssi
Aruba networks
Overview of the design solution
The project is about RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) which retrieves the RSSI for each wireless network in the environment. The API used in the project are fake API’s or imaginary API.
Please enable your Wi-Fi before you start with the installation. After installation, the user needs to accept to allow device location by clicking using the app option.  In designing the solution, I thought of including a company image as a splash screen, some of corporate colors and launcher icon for consistency. The results of the retrieved network are presented in a listview, where the user will be able to click a button “Scan network” to retrieve the RSSI that will be displayed in the UI (user interface device). The “Click here for json rest api” button will take you to another screen where you will be able to enter values or information as indicated in the UI and after that the user can click post values button that will post the data to the server, or the user can click “clear” button to refresh or clear the page.

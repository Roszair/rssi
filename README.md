Aruba networks
Overview of the design solution
I have used Android Studio to design and develop the project. The project palette included are listView, buttons, editText, splash and textText for both XML files. The drawable included are for Aruba networks as well as their corporate colors. 
After installation, please accept the pop-up message for “allow device location” as this part is used for the first layout that is scanning the network. Also remember to “Allow while using the device”.
